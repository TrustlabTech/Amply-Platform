# Amply-Trustlab

Amply is for Early Childhood Development service-delivery. Amply for ECD provides verified digital registries of ECD Service Providers, ECD centres and the children who are eligible beneficiaries. Service delivery records are captured as verifiable claims. Each service transaction generates a digital cryptographic token that can be exchanged for value, such as a government subsidy or social impact bond payment. The personal data collected through this service delivery are managed using the Consent Protocol, which enables consented sharing of personal information between trusted identities

## Purpose
Amply vision is to have a completely open,decentralised,autonomous social benefit platform that can underpin a range of services and funding model. This will increase trust, decrease administrative costs, reduce benefit fraud and provide richer data to demonstrate service performance and outcomes.
